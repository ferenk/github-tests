# Obsidian Tokenz

Use any kind of short codes in Obsidian with using code maps:

- <u><b>Built-in</u></b> maps can be used immedately:
	- **emojis** (``:smile:`` 🙂, ``:wink:`` 😉, ...),
		and the classic, good old
	- **smileys** ( **``:-)``** 🙂, **``8-D``** 😎, ...).
- <u><b>User defined</b></u> maps can be in any format you like, for example:
	▎🏆 --- Tokenz beginning with "!": ``!success``
	▋💡--- CSS class style short code: ``.idea``
	▉ 📺  Or any format you can imagine, e.g: ``|tv_episode|``
For further explanation and a short configuration guide see [2](###user-defined-code-maps).
